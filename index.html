        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements. It is the
            building blocks of a webpage.</p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS is responsible for the visuals aspects of the webpage. This includes the fonts, colours, dimensions of
            elements and is even capable of creating simple animations and transitions.
            <h4>JAVASCRIPT</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
